title: Setting Up Python on the Circuit Playground Express
---

Here's how to set up Python on your Circuit Playground Express (CPX) board.

## Installing Python
Download the latest version of CircuitPython from [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_express/). Save it somewhere handy.

With the CPX plugged into your computer, double-click the `RESET` button. (It's the small one in the middle!) A USB drive named `CPLAYBOOT` should appear on your computer. (If double-clicking doesn't work, try a single-click.)

## Installing the Mu Editor
Install the Mu editor from [here](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/releases/tag/1.1.0-alpha.2).

Mu is the easiest editor to get started with, please use it, unless you are an experienced coder with a favorite editor already!
